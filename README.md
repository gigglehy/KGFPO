Domain knowledge map of flood disaster spatio-temporal process observation
The process of collecting information in the field of spatio-temporal process observation of flood disasters is cumbersome, and it is very difficult to unify data from different sources. It cannot well support requirements such as disaster risk assessment. The knowledge graph ontology of spatio-temporal process observation of flood disasters includes flood disaster databases, geographical resource databases and Structured data sources such as remote sensing satellite resource directories also include ubiquitous text data such as field literature and disaster emergency industry websites. Different modules in the flood disaster spatio-temporal process observation ontology have different data sources: flood disaster event data sources, flood disaster observation task data sources, flood disaster data data sources, flood disaster model method data sources, and flood disaster observation resource data sources.
